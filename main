	Updated: 20th May 2025
	
	* GUI now loads in after youve joined the match, so execute once and that should be it.
	* Fixed dying bug where it would cause script to not work after dying once.
	* Removed some functions that were pretty much dead ends, hopefully can implement them fr next update.
	* Kill Aura is less buggy but still has a few issues (sometimes target doesnt want to get hit).
	
	Adding a "sissy mode" and different kill options for kill aura.
